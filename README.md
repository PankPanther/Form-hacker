Form Hacker Extension - README
Overview
Form Hacker is a browser extension developed by Pankaj Aswal designed to help developers and security professionals manipulate and test HTML forms. It provides users with tools to inspect, manipulate, and submit form data easily for debugging, testing, and security assessment purposes. By using this extension, users can gain insights into how web forms function and can test various security vulnerabilities like CSRF, XSS, and more.

Features
Form Field Inspection: View and analyze all form elements (input fields, hidden fields, buttons, etc.) present on a web page.
Form Data Manipulation: Modify form values, attributes (e.g., disabled, readonly, etc.), or change field types (e.g., turning a hidden field into a visible one).
Automatic Form Submission: Easily submit forms with modified or pre-populated data for testing or debugging purposes.
Security Testing: Test web forms for common security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and parameter tampering.
Easy-to-Use Interface: A simple and intuitive interface that integrates seamlessly with the browser's developer tools, allowing quick access to form data.
Installation
Download and Install:
You can install the Form Hacker extension from the relevant extension store for your browser (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.).

Activate the Extension:
After installation, activate the extension by clicking on the Form Hacker icon in the browser toolbar.

Enable Developer Tools Integration:
The extension works best when used alongside browser developer tools. Open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I), and youâ€™ll find a new "Form Hacker" tab.

How to Use
Open a Web Page with Forms:
Navigate to any web page containing a form that you wish to inspect or manipulate.

Inspect Form Elements:
Click on the "Form Hacker" icon in your browser toolbar, or open the "Form Hacker" tab from your browser's developer tools. You will see a list of all forms on the current page.

Modify Form Data:
Use the provided tools to edit field values, change field types, or enable/disable specific fields. You can also populate fields with preset or custom values for testing purposes.

Submit Forms:
After making changes, you can submit the form directly through the Form Hacker interface. The extension will send the data to the server, allowing you to test how the backend handles the modified request.

Security Testing:
Form Hacker enables you to identify vulnerabilities by modifying hidden or restricted fields and testing the server's response to manipulated data.

Security Considerations
For Educational and Testing Purposes Only: This extension is designed for ethical testing, debugging, and development. Users are advised to use this tool responsibly and only on systems and websites they own or have explicit permission to test.
Risk of Misuse: Manipulating forms on websites without permission may violate terms of service and could be illegal. Always ensure you have the necessary authorization to test and manipulate forms.
